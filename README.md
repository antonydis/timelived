# Time Lived – Your Life in Months

This is a simple interactive website that lets you visualize your life in months, based on a 90-year life expectancy.

## Why I built this?

Life moves fast — and sometimes we forget to pause and reflect.

This project is a minimalist tool that lets you enter your **date of birth**, and then see how many **months you've lived** — out of a total of 1,080 months (90 years). It highlights those months visually in a grid of circles.

Each filled circle represents a month you've already experienced. The empty ones? They're your future.

More than a productivity tool, this is an **invitation to pause** — to:

- Appreciate how far you’ve come
- Reflect on the beautiful moments you’ve lived
- Realize how much time we sometimes spend on things that don’t matter (like endless hours on your phone)
- Reconnect with your goals and intentions

I was inspired by [Tim Urban’s article on *Wait But Why*](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), where he visualizes a human life in weeks. It made me stop and reflect — on everything I’ve already lived, what truly matters, and how easily our energy gets drained by distractions.

## How it works?

1. The user enters their **birthdate**
2. The script calculates how many **months** have passed until today
3. It fills that number of circles (out of 1,080) to show life lived so far
4. It displays the **percentage of life lived**
5. A short reflective question invites the user to pause and think
